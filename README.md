### GoFit!

![ui](readme/readme-media/ui.png)

There are a lot of gym membership website but I made this a little different. I did a little research, correct me if I am wrong but I have not seen any fitness gym website that offeres membership to use the gym facility, join classes and the site is also a shopping site that users/member/non member could buy healthy options of meals, snacks and drinks.

## **Features**
### NAVIGATION BAR ON ALL PAGES WITH ACTIVE HIGHLIGHT
  ![Nav Bar](static/readme-images/desktopnav.png)

  ![Nav Bar](static/readme-images/mobilenav.png)

   -  My very first project with Code Institute was a Blog Site and I mentioned there that I think the most important thing about a website is the navigation bar, to me it should not be complicated to use it and it should be visible with easy to the eyes color. My navbar turns into a toggle button when the screen size go smaller. The Navigation bar also highlights what page the user is currently in. Up until today, this is still something I think should be necessary nothing beats simplicity  

### CAPTURING USERS ATTENTION WITH CAROUSEL 

  ![carousel](static/readme-images/carousel.mp4)

   -  As a user one thing that attracts me to use a website is a short homepage with a short description of what it is all about. To me when the home page is too long and too wordy, it is already a turn off form me. This may differ to different people so this is only base on my personal preference. The photo I think adds a personal touch. 

### SOCIAL LINKS

  ![Social Links](static/readme-images/footerandsocialmedia.png)

  - In this day and age, Social Media is everywhere and 99% of the population probably has one, so having social links on all pages of your website not only makes your website look aesthestically pleasing but as well as it could help users find your easier. Especially when you are offering services. 


### review
  ![Reviews](static/readme-images/review.png)

  - Putting a few reviews instantly visible gives a massive inpact to the users without having to be looking around.


### ADMIN FUNCTIONALITY
  ![admin ](static/readme-images/AdminFunctionality.png)

  - Having a Link that you can download pdf files are very important when it comes to websites that provide information. 

  ### CONTACT PAGE 
  ![Contact Page](static/readme-images/contact.png)

  - Contact Pages I think is one of the most usefukl pages in a website, it provides user comfort that they can reach out to someone if they do have additional information. 

  ### REGISTER PAGE 
  ![Register Page](static/readme-images/register.png)

  - This site is for a member only Travel Assistance Site . 

### **Language Used**
  - English

### **Navigation Bar**
- I have used Materialized for my Navigation bar which basic functionality for easy use. Using Bootstrap helps with the mobile first functionality of my website. Apart from this I have also added a highlight on the current page that the user is on. 

### **Landing Page**
- My landing page speaks for itself, the cover photo shows what the site is for and about. It also has my personal introduction which explains about the site. 

### **Footer**
- Social Media links which uses fontawesome icons to make it look appealing.

### **Future Features**
- I was hoping to add a little bit more pages to offer other services but I havent got a lot of time to finish this project.

## **Testing**
### Bugs and Issues

  - #### Code Issues
    
- Allauth installation was not installing even with the 0.41.0 , student care was able to assist me with the providing the most updated allauth which was the 54.0

- Image was not loading because staticfiles path was not a tuple

- Forgot to double the underscore in the views.py to show the categories, only had one underscore causing it to show an error. Had to recheck the walkthrough to compare my work and realized I missed the 2nd underscore. 

- The Sort drop down did not work, realized that I was in the wrong version of bootsrap. Changed my version from 5.0 to 4.6 and used the code from this version and the dropped down worked. 

- When trying to deploy my work to heroku I get an fail to deploy. I googled everywhere but it keeps saying that I did not set up the s3 and iam correctly so I followed the video again and it still getting the same error. I immidietly contacted student support who gave me the updated steps to do the s3 and Iam, this has resolved trhe issue I have been having. 

- The images in my GoFit products are not showing thinking it might have been the url but it isnt. It showing a appended data. What I did is I went to the admin django and removed the image that is currently there and replaced it with the one that is not appended it resolve the issues.

- The imahes in my Facility Gallery are also not showing found out that it is hard coded reason why it showing in local but not the deployed one. tutor support rebecca told me to add this format  {{ MEDIA_URL }}image_name.png but still was not working so 

- remove option was not working, having to look at what was missing on my code. The only thing that solved the problem  was correcting a typo on the script source.

- update and remove button are not working in the deployed site but are working on the local host , I did not do any changes with this resolved by refreshing multiple times and closing the gitpos dev env.

- The scroll up and down in toast is not working - This resolved itself overtime, I somehow made it work but could not figure out what I change to make it work. 

- PROBLEM TO SOLVE"  Stripe Payment field is not showing, this was a miss on my end, it was showing but I could not see it because it was behind the background image. I found out about it when I did a dev tools inspecting it. 

- After installing pip3 install django-countries==7.2.1 and editing the models, tried migrating and it keeps getting this error 
   ![Error](readme/readme-media/errors.png)
   ![Edit](readme/readme-media/editmigration1.png)
  ![Edit2](readme/readme-media/editmigration2.png)
    
 googled this issue and after hours of searching I found this 

  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8484689/django-form-database-error-value-too-long-for-type-character-varying4

- I could not find what he was saying column max lenght but did find this
I wasn't too sure waht I need to put in there but research about it but couldnt find anything so I bit my tongue and just changed it to 1000 and did the migrate and it WORKED I checked botique ado migrations and its still oon 2 so I was wondering what could have caused it. I changed it back to 2 for now and will have a look into it when I have more time in my hands. 
#PROBLEM TO SOLVE = SIGN UP DOS NOT DIRECT YOU TO THE VERIFY EMAIL PAGE BUT DIRECTS YOU TO THJE MAIN PAGE. EVERYTHIONG LOOKS OKAY BUT FIGURE IT OUT LATER

## **Deployment & Usage**
### **Deployment**
To deploy my site on Git Hub I made the following steps. I found out how to deploy my project when I was playing around with github trying to fix my incorrect path which hinders my images to load up on live. 

These are the steps:

 - Go to the Settings tab of your GitHub repo.
 - On the left-hand sidebar, in the Code and automation section, select Pages.
 - Make sure: Source is set to 'Deploy from Branch'.
 - Main branch is selected.
 - Folder is set to / (root).
 - Under Branch, click Save.
 - Go back to the Code tab. Wait a few minutes for the build to 
 - finish and refresh your repo.
 - On the right-hand side, in the Environments section, click on 'github-pages'.
 - Click View deployment to see the live site

### **Fork**
  1.  On GitHub.com, navigate to the experience-croatia repository.
  2.  In the top-right corner of the page, click Fork.
  3.  Under "Owner," select the dropdown menu and click an owner for the forked repository.
  4.  By default, forks are named the same as their upstream repositories. Optionally, to further distinguish your fork, in the "Repository name" field, type a name.
  5.  Optionally, in the "Description" field, type a description of your fork.
  6.  Optionally, select Copy the DEFAULT branch only.
  7.  Click Create fork.

### **Cloning**
  1.  On GitHub.com, navigate to your fork of the Spoon-Knife repository.
  2.  Above the list of files, click  Code.
  3.  Copy the URL for the repository.
    - To clone the repository us
    itory using an SSH key, including a certificate issued by your organization's SSH certificate authority, click SSH, then click .
    - To clone a repository using GitHub CLI, click GitHub CLI, then click .
  4.  Open Git Bash.
  5.  Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory.
  6.  Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied earlier. It will look like this, with your GitHub username instead of YOUR-USERNAME:
  7.  Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

## **Credits**
