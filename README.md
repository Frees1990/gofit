## **Deployment & Usage**
### **Deployment**
To deploy my site on Git Hub I made the following steps. I found out how to deploy my project when I was playing around with github trying to fix my incorrect path which hinders my images to load up on live. 

These are the steps:

 - Go to the Settings tab of your GitHub repo.
 - On the left-hand sidebar, in the Code and automation section, select Pages.
 - Make sure: Source is set to 'Deploy from Branch'.
 - Main branch is selected.
 - Folder is set to / (root).
 - Under Branch, click Save.
 - Go back to the Code tab. Wait a few minutes for the build to 
 - finish and refresh your repo.
 - On the right-hand side, in the Environments section, click on 'github-pages'.
 - Click View deployment to see the live site

### **Fork**
  1.  On GitHub.com, navigate to the "https://github.com/Frees1990/gofit" repository.
  2.  In the top-right corner of the page, click Fork.
  3.  Under "Owner," select the dropdown menu and click an owner for the forked repository.
  4.  By default, forks are named the same as their upstream repositories. Optionally, to further distinguish your fork, in the "Repository name" field, type a name.
  5.  Optionally, in the "Description" field, type a description of your fork.
  6.  Optionally, select Copy the DEFAULT branch only.
  7.  Click Create fork.

### **Cloning**
  1.  On GitHub.com, navigate to your fork of the Spoon-Knife repository.
  2.  Above the list of files, click  Code.
  3.  Copy the URL for the repository.
    - To clone the repository us
    itory using an SSH key, including a certificate issued by your organization's SSH certificate authority, click SSH, then click .

  4.  Open Git Bash.
  5.  Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory.
